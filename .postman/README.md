# 1. General info
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0-blue?style=for-the-badge)  
This directory contains postman collections with requests.  
It consists of:  
* postman environment - it contains all required variables
* postman collection - it contains all requests, which are available in application
* input_files - it contains all files, which are required by postman collections  

During development process we are using standalone Postman application (Chrome extension is deprecated).  
You can get it from here:  
https://www.getpostman.com/  

# 2. Development
In case you want to develop this collection:
* Import them to your postman  
* Apply necessary changes  
* Export them (notice: for collection use v. 2.1). If you don't see such option, make sure to update Postman.
